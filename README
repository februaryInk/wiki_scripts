Run script modules to generate data output for use on the wiki.

```
python -m script.<script_file_name>
```

==Asset Bundles==

Use AssetStudioMod to export **MonoBehaviour**, **MonoScript**, **GameObject** from the following:

localization/<language>
designer_config
scene/additive/*
storyscript
resourcepoint

And **Texture2D** and **Sprite** from:

uisystem_sprite
