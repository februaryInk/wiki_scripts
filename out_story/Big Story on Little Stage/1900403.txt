{{dialogue|Owen|You give me something to work with, and I'll improvise and move on to the next line in the script. Everything should be fine!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Okay, so the major rewrite is just the scene where we meet. It'll be like last time, but a little different. Your first line isn't where it was before.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Now your first line is after I say,"Dearest spirit of the Evergreen, listen to my words, as they may be my last... " Here, you'll give me a gift that will bring me back to life!}}

Title: The Traveler's Evergreen: Saved by the Kneel!
A Review by Jasmine
All in all, it was the spectacle of a lifetime! But not because of the acting. While ''Player'' tried to keep everything together with their believable and nuanced performance, the pacing was dragged down a bit by Owen, who is still getting used to the stage.
Owen's meager performance as the eponymous "traveler" in fact lent itself to what happened next; there is absolutely no way Owen could've faked his emotions during his unbelievably moving declaration of love to ''Player'', after which, he got down on one knee and popped the question!
Tickets to this show were five Gols, but the show we got... was priceless.
